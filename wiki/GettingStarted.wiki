#summary Getting Started Guide for developers


= Download =

Download and install the following programs:

  * [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-7u1-download-513651.html JDK]
  * [http://qt.nokia.com/downloads QT SDK]
  * [http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html Tortoise SVN]
  * [http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=8279 Windows 7 SDK]
    * Enable `Redistributable Packages >> Debugging Tools`

= Configure Environment =
run the following in a CMD window session.
{{{
setx JAVA_HOME "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_01"
}}}

Restart QTCreator or any shell sessions you are using after using setx.

= Getting the code =
Go to http://code.google.com/p/jrt-dma/source/checkout for svn checkout instructions.

= Building =
Once you have the code, double click the `agent.pro` file. QtCreator will open the project up.

== Static QT build ==

  # Install MSVC 2010.
  # Download and extract [http://dl.dropbox.com/u/15436827/x64-MSVC-2010-static-4.7.4.7z x64-MSVC-2010-static-4.7.4.7z] to `C:\Qt\x64-MSVC-2010-static-4.7.4\`.  The C:\Qt\ part is important.  You may need to install [http://www.7-zip.org/ 7zip].
  # Add 64-MSVC-2010-static-4.7.4 as a tool chain and use it with MSVC2010.
    * Go to Tools >> Options >> Qt4 >> Add
    * Add C:\Qt\x64-MSVC-2010-static-4.7.4\qmake.exe
    * Open DDAgent.pro if you havn't already.
    * Go to Projects >> Build
    * Change Qt Version: to `Qt 4.7.4 (x64-MSVC-2010-static-4.7.4)`
    * Change Tool chain to: `Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler 10.0 (amd64)`


= Running the Agent =
  Open a build directory that contains DDagent.dll in cmd.exe
{{{
  java -agentpath:DDagent.dll JavaProgram
}}}


= Developement Guide Lines =

Do not work in directly in trunk!

  # Copy the branch from `trunk/` into a topic branch `branches/myBugFix`.
  # Work in `branches/myBugFix`.
  # Get a [http://code.google.com/p/jrt-dma/issues/entry?show=review&former=sourcelist Code Review].
  # once Code Review has been approved by another team member, merge code into trunk
