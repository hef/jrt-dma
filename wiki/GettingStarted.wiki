Do not work in directly in trunk!

  # Copy the branch from `trunk/` into a topic branch `branches/myBugFix`.
  # Work in `branches/myBugFix`.
  # Get a [http://code.google.com/p/jrt-dma/issues/entry?show=review&former=sourcelist Code Review].
  # once Code Review has been approved by another team member, merge code into trunk
